### Tracking and disclosing security issues

If you have discovered a web security flaw that might impact our products,
please let us know.  If you submit a report, here's what will happen:

* We will acknowledge your report and give you means to track the progress of
  your issue.

* We will investigate the issue and determine how it impacts our products.  We
  won't disclose issues until our investigation is finished, but we will work
  with you to ensure we fully understand the issue.

* Once the issue is resolved, we'll release a security update along with thanks
  and credit for the discovery.

We use a variety of technology to provide _Alces Flight Gridware_, including the widely

affect any of the various technologies we use. We ask for your patience while
we also make sure other companies and their customers are protected. In any
case, you will always have a contact at Alces Flight who will be directly
responsible for ensuring that your issue is addressed.
